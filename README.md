# 42_push_swap
Project for 42 School 'Push_Swap'
This project hasn't been submited yet. Although I am fairly confident in its evaluation.

Makefile is still missing and will be uploaded ASAP.

Special thanks to Pedro Alexandre @ https://github.com/palzap for help with this project.
My push_swap uses a 'homebrewn' sort by Alex Mitcul @ https://github.com/AlexMitcul .
